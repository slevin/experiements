{-
done
* starting point set
* draw boxes
* given one box find matching set to remove


----
todo

* I could figure out how to draw the matches by
 turning yellow set matching one hovered over
* adjust points so that they "fall down" and "fall left"
 only remove if group is larger than 1

* animate highlighting of matching points

* animate falling down

* how do I get interaction with mouse click
 do I add a listener for each item or something?
 what about hover


iterate for matching points do graph thing I think
 take current, get potential neighbors
 add to list of checked
 check each potential neighbor if same color, and not already checked
    add it to list of to check
