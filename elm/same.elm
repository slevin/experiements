{-
Same Game implementation.

5 high by 10 wide squares of 3 colors
starts with random color assignment

click on one of those squares
if there is at least one neighboring square (nsew), disappears those squares

remaining square fall down and to the left (in that order)
until all are gone
or no more squares have neighbors

goal:
- use signals

check list:
- respond to click
- check neighbors
- remove those guys if necessary
- redraw squares

small steps:


limit size to fit area


then I need to set up some response to mouse tap

which can somehow build up a list of things that will disappear
then need to remove those from the list of everything and rerender
the state crazy
