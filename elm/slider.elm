{-

draw board
  turn board into list of lists -> group/sort/sort
  elements are squares with number inside them
  and then have a an input signal attached to them which signals a new tile

add signals to elements

signal does swap with empty under its selection
 foldp on input signal does swap with empty
 might be kind of easy

detect win condition and show some element that its won

then do some reverse shuffling on start

then try for animations with swapping
