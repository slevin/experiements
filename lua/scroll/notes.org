could get a testing thing going (just a rakefile would be fine gulp was overkill)



better way to capture card stack vs uicardstack?
  it does work though
  just look for duplicate code and separate stuff

ideal with ui is to make intent explicit


need to capture the display objects to iterate over, not the original cardModels


take a card stack model

create a cardStackUIModel
 creates each ui element
 and renders it
